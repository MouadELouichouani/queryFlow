# ML workflow

## Every ML project follows these logical steps

- Data Collection – gather relevant data (CSV, API, images, etc.)
- Data Preprocessing – clean, normalize, and prepare it
- Model Selection – choose the right algorithm (linear regression, decision tree, CNN, etc.)
- Training – feed the data to the model to learn
- Evaluation – test how well it performs on unseen data
- Tuning – improve it using hyperparameters or feature engineering
- Deployment – integrate into an app (which you already know well)
